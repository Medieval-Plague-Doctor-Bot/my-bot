# Announcing the deprecation of Medieval Plague Doctor Bot

With the new message intent coming out, I am stopping the development of my bot.
As many of you know, Discord released slash commands a while back.
Now they're forcing every bot developer with a bot in 75+ guilds (servers) to implement slash commands in place of normal commands by April 2022 unless if they request and are granted the intent which is very unlikely.
And not every library officially supports slash commands including the one I use.
The bot will be going offline before April of 2022 and the support server has been deleted.
